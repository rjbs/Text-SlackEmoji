        - drop the required version, since what we need a higher version for is
          building the shared emoji mapping, not using it
        - simlarly, make it possible to load only emoji for which your perl
          knows the UCD data

        - turn that frownâ€¦ upside down!
          (:simple_smile: was mapped to 1F641 instead of 1F642)

        - generate emoji list from https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data
          (thanks for the pointer, Rob N.!)

          This gets tons more emoji, but some of them are not known Slack
          emoji, so it's a bit of a trade off.

        - update prereq to perl 5.14.0 for new enough Unicode
        - add a few more emoji, but still missing plenty

        - there's a new method, ->load_emoji, to reload the emoji mapping
          without needing to reload the module
        - add a few emoji, but surely there are ones left to go
        - you know what would be great?  a patch that started by getting the
          full list of emoji from the Slack API

        - first release!
        - thanks to all contributors, especially Jakes Goldsborough, who
          provided more mappings than my first meagre listing
