        - there's a new method, ->load_emoji, to reload the emoji mapping
          without needing to reload the module
        - add a few emoji, but surely there are ones left to go
        - you know what would be great?  a patch that started by getting the
          full list of emoji from the Slack API

        - first release!
        - thanks to all contributors, especially Jakes Goldsborough, who
          provided more mappings than my first meagre listing
